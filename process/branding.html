hardware creators often choose to keep their intellectual property closed rather than open. Using unique brand names, product names, and logos serve a valuable purpose in signaling the source of a product and letting downstream users know that they are using a product made by its original creator.</p><p>As trademarks serve as an indication of who is responsible for a specific piece of hardware, it is important to make sure that you are the only one using your trademark. In most cases it does not make sense to openly license your brand name, product names or logos. For more information about why trademarks are a useful tool for open source projects, see these articles <a href="https://opensource.com/business/11/6/open-business-importance-trademarks-even-open-source-business">here</a> and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/165161/trademarks_open_source_friendly.html">here</a>.</p><p>A product’s name, any logos used on its packaging, the physical product or certain documentation may be subject to protection by trademark law. How robust this protection is depends whether the name or logo is descriptive of the product itself or whether the name is more creative and less tied to what the product is or does. Note that certain names, i.e., generic or purely descriptive names might have <a href="http://www.bitlaw.com/trademark/degrees.html">no or very little protection</a>.</p><p>If you plan to use your project commercially, registering your brand name, product names, and logos as registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) can provide a broader protection and benefits than that afforded to trademarks that aren’t registered. Registration is relatively inexpensive, but it can be a complicated process–you may want to consult with a trademark attorney before attempting to register your marks. OSHWA may also be able to connect you with law school clinics that provide this service at reduced rates. Learn more about trademarks and registration in the U.S. on the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics">USPTO’s website</a>.</p><p>Additionally, a product’s design itself can serve as a form of trademark if the design is signals to consumers the source of the product. This protection may not be as robust for a number of reasons discussed in this section.</p><p>Trademark law prevents other people from using your brand name or logo on their own hardware. It does not stop them from merely copying your hardware, so long as they do not use your name or logo. It also does not stop them from copying your product’s function so long as they do not copy its trademark-protected design.</p></div></div></section><section class="page-section page-section--process slide-panel__wrapper--compact" data-nav-order="2" id="spectrum"><div class="row"><a class="checklist slide-panel__open-trigger" data-term="checklist"><i class="material-icons">list</i></a><div class="slide-panel__wrapper slide-panel__wrapper--checklist"><div class="slide-panel" data-direction="right" data-value="checklist"><div class="slide-panel__container slide-panel__container--checklist"><div class="row slide-panel__close"><a href="#" class="slide-panel__close-trigger"><i class="material-icons slide-close-checklist"></i></a></div><div class="slide-panel__content"><div class="slide-panel__checklist"><h4>Checklist</h4><p>Does your product have any branding elements?</p><p>Have you chosen original brand names, product names, logos, and product designs (if applicable)?</p><p>Have you read the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics">USPTO Trademark Basics Guide</a>?</p><p>Have you consulted with a trademark lawyer, or registered your trademarks on your own?</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="column large-12"><h2>Spectrum</h2></div></div><div class="row"><div class="column large-12"><p>Lulzbot’s branding is fully protected because their brand name is unique, it does not simply describe what the product is, and it features a unique and original logo.

products that are actually sold to customers may receive some protection over their product design. This type of protection is called “Trade dress.” Trade dress protection may apply if the product design is not essential to the use or functionality of the product, if it does not affect the cost or quality of the product, and if the design has become so associated with that specific product that users know the design as a sort of logo for the product itself.</p><ul><li>For example, Mycroft may be able to argue that the face-like shape of their speakers is purely a design choice, which does not affect the quality of their product. If users have come to know that shape as uniquely being a Mycroft product, they may be able to stop other users from making similarly shaped products.</li><li>The fact that Mycroft allows downstream users to <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/hardware-mycroft-mark-1">access the design files</a> for their product and because they have <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/hardware-mycroft-mark-1/tree/master/License">licensed the product</a> under the CERN OHL, which allows downstream users to manufacture or distribute the product (including its design) would make it difficult for Mycroft to rely on trade dress to protect their product, as they’ve arguably invited other products to use their unique design for their own products. But, if another manufacturer were to try and use Mycroft’s brand name or logos in selling a competing product, Mycroft would have protection against that, because Mycroft has a <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=87002931&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">registered trademark</a> in the U.S.</li></ul><p><strong>COPYRIGHT</strong> Under copyright law, the artistic elements of a project may be protectable, if they are original, unique, and creative. However, the purely functional elements of a product’s design are not protected by copyright law. This line can be blurry and difficult to ascertain though, as explained in detail <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/blog/archives/29985-decision-in-the-cheerleader-uniform-case-and-a-new-test-for-copyright.html">here</a>.</p><ul><li>For example: Mycroft may be able to argue that the unique face-like shape of their speaker is artistic and not purely functional, and thus it may qualify for some form of copyright protection if a downstream user were to make their own products in a similarly shaped case.</li><li>Importantly, Mycroft has <a href="https://github.com/MycroftAI/hardware-mycroft-mark-1/tree/master/License">licensed the product</a> under the CERN OHL, which allows downstream users to manufacture or distribute the product (including its design), with Mycroft’s permission, thus they have opened up the product for other users to be able to legally make their own Mark 1’s.</li></ul><div class="slide-panel__wrapper slide-panel__wrapper--checklist"><div class="slide-panel" data-direction="right" data-value="checklist"><div class="slide-panel__container slide-panel__container--checklist"><div class="row slide-panel__close"><a href="#" class="slide-panel__close-trigger"><i class="material-icons slide-close-checklist"></i></a></div><div class="slide-panel__content"><div class="slide-panel__checklist"><h4>Checklist</h4><p>Does your product have any branding elements?</p><p>Have you chosen original brand names, product names, logos, and product designs (if applicable)?</p><p>Have you read the <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks-getting-started/trademark-basics">USPTO Trademark Basics Guide</a>?</p><p>Have you consulted with a trademark lawyer, or registered your trademarks on your own?</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="modals-wrapper"><div class="row"><div class="column small-12 large-12 modals-container"><h3>Branding Information Examples</h3></div><div class="column large-12"><div class="row"><div class="columns large-3 medium-6 small-12 modal-container js-open-modal"><span class="modal-container__title">Apertus AXIOM</span><div class="modal-container__tags"><span class="tag">Electronics platform</span> <span class="tag">Input/Sensor</span></div><span class="learn-why">Learn why</span><div class="modal js-target-modal"><div class="modal__header modal--top-section"><i class="modal__close material-icons js-close-modal">close</i></div><div class="modal__content"><h3>Apertus AXIOM</h3><p class="license-header">Branding Information:</p><p></p><p>AXIOM is a name that does not merely describe what the hardware does.

OSHWA has also partnered with the <a href="http://www.cardozo.yu.edu/techstartupclinic">Cardozo Law School Tech Startup Clinic</a>. The clinic has agreed to receive referrals from OSHWA for free and low-cost legal advice regarding the certification process.</p><p>If you do not wish to register your marks, you may still have some legal protection, but it can be more difficult to enforce your rights.</p><p>If you prefer to leave your project as open as possible and do not wish to restrict downstream users’ ability to use your brand name, product name, logos, or product designs, you can do so by simply not enforcing your rights to protect these elements. There is no “open trademark license” currently available, but there have been attempts to create licensing regimes that experiment with the boundaries of an “open” trademark license.</p></div></div></section><div class="divider divider--teal divider--next"><div class="row expanded row--certify"><div class="columns small-12"><div class="content content--left"><div class="arrow"><a id="read-next" href="/oshwa/process/documentation.html"><i class="material-icons" id="arrow">chevron_left</i></a></div><div class="text"><h1>Learn About</h1><a id="read-next" href="/oshwa/process/documentation.html">Documentation</a></div></div></div><div class="columns small-12"><div class="content content--right content--right--certify"><div class="text"><h1>I'm Ready!</h1><a id="read-next" href="https://oshwa-certify.herokuapp.com/apply">Certify my Project</a></div><div class="arrow"><a id="read-next" href="https://oshwa-certify.herokuapp.com/apply"><i class="material-icons" id="arrow">chevron_right</i></a></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer class="footer"></footer><div class="copyright"></div><div id="overlay" class="js-overlay"></div><script src="/oshwa/vendor/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script><script src="/oshwa/vendor/slick.min.js"></script><script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/list.js/1.5.0/list.min.js"></script><script src="/oshwa/assets/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
